<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">The cave</span> they slept in, halfway down Olympus</div>
<div class="verse">On the eastern slope, toward Asia, whence the archangels</div>
<div class="verse">Even then were coming&mdash;even then</div>
<div class="verse">Bright Michael, and tall Gabriel, and the dark-faced</div>
<div class="verse">Raphael, healer of men&#8217;s wounds, were flying,</div>
<div class="verse">Flying toward the ship all ten would take&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">The cave they slept in sparkled as their eyelids</div>
<div class="verse">Opened; burned as they rose and stood; hummed</div>
<div class="verse">And trembled as the seven, the beautiful gods</div>
<div class="verse">Gazed at each other, wonderful again.</div>
<div class="verse">The sweet sleep of centuries was over,</div>
<div class="verse">If only as in dream; if only a mortal</div>
<div class="verse">Summer woke them out of endless death.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The grey eyes of Athene, flashing slowly,</div>
<div class="verse">Demanded of Hermes more than he could tell.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;It was not I that roused you.&#8221; Hermes pondered,</div>
<div class="verse">Tightening his sandals. &#8220;All at once,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
<div class="verse">And equally, we woke. Apollo there&mdash;&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">The musical man-slayer listened and frowned&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;And Ares, and foam-loving Aphrodite</div>
<div class="verse">Yawned at the very instant Artemis did,</div>
<div class="verse">With me, and swart Hephaestus.&#8221; The lame smith,</div>
<div class="verse">Stroking his leather apron, blinked at the others,</div>
<div class="verse">Worshipful of brilliance. Even in Ares,</div>
<div class="verse">Scowling, and more quietly in her</div>
<div class="verse">The huntress, whose green robe the animals knew,</div>
<div class="verse">He found it; and of course in Aphrodite,</div>
<div class="verse">Wife to him once, he found it, a relentless</div>
<div class="verse">Laughter filling her eyes and her gold limbs.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;It was not I,&#8221; said Hermes.</div>
<div class="indent14">Thunder sounded,</div>
<div class="verse">Weakly and far away. And yet no distance</div>
<div class="verse">Wrapped it. It was here in the lit cavern:</div>
<div class="verse">Here, or nowhere. And the trembling seven</div>
<div class="verse">Turned to the rock that sealed a deeper room.</div>
<div class="verse">There Zeus, there Hera sat, the feasted prisoners</div>
<div class="verse">Of a still greater person, one who changed</div>
<div class="verse">The world while there they mourned, remembering Ida.</div>
<div class="verse">Some day they too would sleep, but now weak thunder</div>
<div class="verse">Witnessed their remnant glory; which appalled</div>
<div class="verse">As ever the proud seven, until Hermes</div>
<div class="verse">Listened and leaned, then spoke.</div>
<div class="indent16">&#8220;It was the king</div>
<div class="verse">Our father. He has willed that we should wander,</div>
<div class="verse">Even as in a dream, and be the gods</div>
<div class="verse">Of strangers. Somewhere west of the ocean stream</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
<div class="verse">He sends us, to a circle of small hills&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Come, for I see the place!&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent14">That suffered thunder</div>
<div class="verse">Sounded again, agreeing; and they went.</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the cave they poured, into spring sun</div>
<div class="verse">Whose warmth they yet increased, for the falling light</div>
<div class="verse">Was less than theirs was, moving as they moved.</div>
<div class="verse">No soldier and no shepherd, climbing here,</div>
<div class="verse">Would have discovered deity. The brambles</div>
<div class="verse">Hid as they ever had this stony hole</div>
<div class="verse">Whence seven had been wakened, and where still,</div>
<div class="verse">Enormous in dark chains, their parents wept.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Invisible to suns, the seven gathered</div>
<div class="verse">Round a white rock and gazed. The sea was there,</div>
<div class="verse">The Aegean, and a ship without a sail</div>
<div class="verse">Plied southward, trailing smoke; at which Hephaestus</div>
<div class="verse">Squinted. Then he slapped his thigh and smiled,</div>
<div class="verse">And waved for six to follow as down world</div>
<div class="verse">He leapt.</div>
<div class="indent5">They landed, all of them, as lightly</div>
<div class="verse">As a fair flock of gulls upon the prow</div>
<div class="verse">Of the tramp <i>Jonathan B. Travis</i>, bound</div>
<div class="verse">Tomorrow for Gibraltar, then northwest,</div>
<div class="verse">Northwest, both night and day, till the ocean stream</div>
<div class="verse">Was conquered. Not a god had ever gone there,</div>
<div class="verse">Not one of these high seven, in the old</div>
<div class="verse">Dark sail time. Now, invisible to waves,</div>
<div class="verse">To men and birds, they watched twelve grimy sailors</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
<div class="verse">Washing their clothes on deck; and wondered still</div>
<div class="verse">At the two wakes behind them, foam and funnel.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But who were these arriving, these gaunt three</div>
<div class="verse">On giant wings that folded as they fell</div>
<div class="verse">And staggered, then stood upright? Even now</div>
<div class="verse">Michael had dropped among them, with his archangel</div>
<div class="verse">Brethren, bony Gabriel and lank Raphael.</div>
<div class="verse">From nearer Asia, lonely a long while,</div>
<div class="verse">They had come flying, sick of the desert silence,</div>
<div class="verse">Sick of the centuries through which no lord,</div>
<div class="verse">No king of the host, had blessed them with command.</div>
<div class="verse">As orphaned eagles, missing their ancient&#8217;s cry,</div>
<div class="verse">They had come hither, hopeful of these seven,</div>
<div class="verse">Hopeful of noble company, of new act.</div>
<div class="verse">Now on the prow they gathered, and no sailor</div>
<div class="verse">Saw them; but Apollo did, and Artemis&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Fingering their bows&mdash;as Hermes reared</div>
<div class="verse">On tiptoe, smiling welcome. Aphrodite,</div>
<div class="verse">Slipping to lee of Ares, feigned a fear</div>
<div class="verse">More beautiful than truth was; while Hephaestus,</div>
<div class="verse">Curious, near-sighted, fingered those wing-joints</div>
<div class="verse">Athene only studied where she stood.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Whoever you are,&#8221; said Hermes, &#8220;and whatever&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Pardon this&mdash;you were, sail now as we do,</div>
<div class="verse">And be the gods of strangers far to west.</div>
<div class="verse">If only as in dream the vessel draws us,</div>
<div class="verse">Zeus our sire consenting. Your own sire&mdash;&#8221;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
<div class="verse">But the three stared so sadly over the waves</div>
<div class="verse">That Hermes paused, and beckoning to Gabriel</div>
<div class="verse">Whispered with him alone while dolphins played</div>
<div class="verse">As lambs do on dry land, and fishes scattered.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Alone to Hermes, while the dolphins heaved</div>
<div class="verse">Grey backs above green water, Gabriel murmured:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Your sire. We had one too. And have Him still,</div>
<div class="verse">Though silent. It is listening for his thunder</div>
<div class="verse">That leans us. He is busy with new folk,</div>
<div class="verse">New, humble folk he speaks to in a low voice.</div>
<div class="verse">We have not learned that language&mdash;humble words,</div>
<div class="verse">With never death or danger in the message.</div>
<div class="verse">A star stood still above a stable once,</div>
<div class="verse">And a weak infant wept. And there He left us.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Our sire,&#8221; said Hermes, &#8220;&mdash;he too sleeps away</div>
<div class="verse">Our centuries. We have the selfsame fortune.</div>
<div class="verse">Sail westward with us then.&#8221; And Gabriel nodded.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The steel that sliced the water swung at length,</div>
<div class="verse">And in three days they nosed between the Pillars;</div>
<div class="verse">Past which&mdash;and the ten all shuddered&mdash;monsters once</div>
<div class="verse">Made chaos of the world&#8217;s end. But no fangs</div>
<div class="verse">Closed over the black prow, and mile on mile</div>
<div class="verse">Slid under them, familiar as a meadow</div>
<div class="verse">To the small men they watched amid the smoke.</div>
<div class="verse">Mile on mile, by hundreds and by thousands,</div>
<div class="verse">The Atlantic sloped away. Then lands and harbors,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
<div class="verse">And a deep whistle groaning.</div>
<div class="indent14">&#8220;Now!&#8221; said Hermes,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Now!&#8221; So nine to one they lifted wing,</div>
<div class="verse">Or no-wing like their leader, and went on,</div>
<div class="verse">High over chimneys and chill rivers, north</div>
<div class="verse">By west till it was there&mdash;the rounded valley,</div>
<div class="verse">Green with new spring, where cattle bawled in barns</div>
<div class="verse">And people, patient, waited for hot June.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Daniel was mending fence, for it was May,</div>
<div class="verse">And early rains had painted the drear pastures.</div>
<div class="verse">He walked, testing the wire, and wished again</div>
<div class="verse">For his old pipe. He missed it, and grew moody.</div>
<div class="verse">Berrien would never notice it on the shelf;</div>
<div class="verse">Berrien would never bring it. A good wife,</div>
<div class="verse">But scornful of the comforts. A good woman,</div>
<div class="verse">Who never guessed the outrage he had done her.</div>
<div class="verse">New Year&#8217;s Eve, and Dora. He remembered&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">And set his jaw, missing the pipe stem there.</div>
<div class="verse">He pulled at a slack strand of the barbed wire,</div>
<div class="verse">And snagged himself&mdash;here, in the palm of his hand.</div>
<div class="verse">A little blood came which he wiped away.</div>
<div class="verse">He did miss that tobacco. And he did,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
<div class="verse">He did loathe simple Dora&mdash;warm and simple,</div>
<div class="verse">Who with her dark head nodding close to his,</div>
<div class="verse">On New Year&#8217;s Eve, had done with him this outrage.</div>
<div class="verse">He would forget her if he could; and old</div>
<div class="verse">Darius, her profane, her grizzled father.</div>
<div class="verse">So proud of her he was, and kept so neat</div>
<div class="verse">The mountain shack they lived in, he and his one</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet chick he swore was safe as in State&#8217;s prison.</div>
<div class="verse">Daniel counted the months. Was the child showing?</div>
<div class="verse">Darius&mdash;did he guess? And Doctor Smith&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Would she have gone to him? Daniel looked off,</div>
<div class="verse">Unmindful of the beautiful May morning.</div>
<div class="verse">Bruce Hanna, that poor boy. Was he suspicious?</div>
<div class="verse">He had been born for Dora, she for him;</div>
<div class="verse">And then last New Year&#8217;s Eve, when the sleigh bells rang</div>
<div class="verse">So slyly, writing ruin in cold air!</div>
<div class="verse">Daniel, wiping his hand again, looked back</div>
<div class="verse">At the wild barb that bit him.</div>
<div class="indent15">Who was that?</div>
<div class="verse">For a quizzical, small stranger stood by the fence,</div>
<div class="verse">Feeling its rust, its toughness. He was swarthy</div>
<div class="verse">And lame, and had bright eyes. And in his hand</div>
<div class="verse">A pipe&mdash;for all the township Daniel&#8217;s own!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Here, have you need of this? I&#8217;m on my way</div>
<div class="verse">Northeast awhile, repairing peoples&#8217; ranges.</div>
<div class="verse">It gave itself to me, but you can have it.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then he was gone, unless he walked and waved&mdash;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
<div class="verse">For someone did&mdash;Daniel could not distinguish&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">From the far border of the field. The small</div>
<div class="verse">Stranger was gone, and all that Daniel held</div>
<div class="verse">Was a filled pipe bowl, comforting his palm.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He must ask Berrien, he said at noon,</div>
<div class="verse">If a lame dwarf had come to mend the cook stove.</div>
<div class="verse">He must ask Berrien, who wouldn&#8217;t listen,</div>
<div class="verse">How a man&#8217;s pipe could vanish from its shelf.</div>
<div class="verse">For so it had, into his very pocket.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Berrien!&#8221; he called. But she was busy</div>
<div class="verse">With her own bother.</div>
<div class="indent10">&#8220;Daniel, a woman&#8217;s here&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Wants to stay and board all summer&mdash;wants</div>
<div class="verse">To rest. A theater woman. I&#8217;ve said no,</div>
<div class="verse">But maybe&mdash;&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent6">Who was the gold one, listening there</div>
<div class="verse">And smiling? Looking over Berrien&#8217;s shoulder</div>
<div class="verse">And lighting the front room with little smiles?</div>
<div class="verse">A faded gold one, well beyond her prime,</div>
<div class="verse">But the true substance, glistening. Berrien frowned</div>
<div class="verse">And her head shook. But Daniel, fascinated,</div>
<div class="verse">Said he would think, would figure.</div>
<div class="indent17">In the end</div>
<div class="verse">She stayed, the theater woman; and that night</div>
<div class="verse">Daniel had dreams of her. She came to his bed</div>
<div class="verse">In beauty; stood beside him and said &#8220;Dora.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">How could she know of Dora? It was a dream,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
<div class="verse">Yet how could she know so much? And how had she fathomed,</div>
<div class="verse">All in one day, the longing he denied?</div>
<div class="verse">There was no loathing. Anywhere in his heart&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">That sweetened as he said it&mdash;there was no hate</div>
<div class="verse">For Dora, whom he thought he saw there too,</div>
<div class="verse">Standing beside the theater woman and weeping,</div>
<div class="verse">And holding her simple hands out so he could say:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Tomorrow, little sweetheart half my years,</div>
<div class="verse">Tomorrow I will tell the world about us.</div>
<div class="verse">You must be mine to keep. I have been cruel;</div>
<div class="verse">I have been absent, darling, from your pain.</div>
<div class="verse">Tomorrow I will put my two arms round you,</div>
<div class="verse">And bear if I can the&mdash;pleasure.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent16">Then he woke,</div>
<div class="verse">And none but Berrien watched him in the room&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Berrien, who ever after watched him,</div>
<div class="verse">Night and day detesting this pale witch</div>
<div class="verse">Who came and went and charmed him.</div>
<div class="indent19">So she thought,</div>
<div class="verse">Said Daniel, never answering her eyes.</div>
<div class="verse">For him there were no hours now save those dark ones</div>
<div class="verse">When the pair came. At midnight they would be there,</div>
<div class="verse">Faithful as moths; and every sunny morning,</div>
<div class="verse">Starting from his pillow, he would mutter:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Tomorrow is today. Then I must go</div>
<div class="verse">To Dora, I must tell her.&#8221; Yet he waited</div>
<div class="verse">Always upon another secret midnight;</div>
<div class="verse">And witnessed every noon how the gold woman,</div>
<div class="verse">Smiling her light smile, seemed not to know</div>
<div class="verse">Of Dora; was no witch at all; was no one.</div>

<div class="verse">Darius had discovered his sweet daughter&#8217;s</div>
<div class="verse">Swelling, and had pressed her for the cause;</div>

<div class="verse">With a gourd dipper, dripping as he drank.</div>
<div class="verse">He listened, lounging, and his bushy eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Burned at the accusation. When Bruce faltered&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">And he did falter, for his hate of Daniel,</div>
<div class="verse">Less than the sore so sudden in his breast,</div>
<div class="verse">So hopeless, so beyond all thought of cure,</div>
<div class="verse">Was a weak thing at first&mdash;this brawny witness</div>
<div class="verse">Shone like a savior in the old one&#8217;s eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">The little old one, dancing in his fury</div>
<div class="verse">As he repeated &#8220;Daniel&#8221;; and made doubly</div>
<div class="verse">Sure that Dora&#8217;s corner room was bolted.</div>
<div class="verse">Afterwards, remembering how the knuckled</div>
<div class="verse">Soldier had spat curses on that name,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Daniel,&#8221; and had spun a scheme for them&mdash;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
<div class="verse">Perfection, he declared it, of revenge&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Darius called him blessed. &#8220;You&#8217;d have failed me,</div>
<div class="verse">Bruce, you would have wobbled like a calf</div>
<div class="verse">And licked this devil&#8217;s hand, but for that sergeant.</div>
<div class="verse">Who sent him here, I wonder?&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent15">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Said Bruce, his mind on Dora&#8217;s room. &#8220;Is she&mdash;&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s in there. And stays there till we&#8217;ve finished.</div>
<div class="verse">When do we go and do it? Think of that&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Think only of that thing, my boy, that needful</div>
<div class="verse">Thing.&#8221; Darius nudged him, and they dropped</div>
<div class="verse">Their voices.</div>
<div class="indent6">Dora, listening, heard little,</div>
<div class="verse">Crouched by her door. Bruce&mdash;he mustn&#8217;t do it.</div>
<div class="verse">Bruce&mdash;he was the only thing she wanted</div>
<div class="verse">In the poor world. A poor one too for Daniel;</div>
<div class="verse">But she shut out the thought. Bruce mustn&#8217;t do it,</div>
<div class="verse">Whatever it was. She beat on the thick wood</div>
<div class="verse">And cried to him; but only heard Darius</div>
<div class="verse">Coaxing him outdoors; then only silence.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;When shall it be, my boy? What dark of the moon</div>
<div class="verse">Does best for our good purpose&mdash;damn his bones!</div>
<div class="verse">Two shotguns&mdash;that&#8217;s enough&mdash;then home, then here&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">That&#8217;s it, and neither knows of it next day.</div>
<div class="verse">We&#8217;ll even shed a hot tear, being told!</div>
<div class="verse">When do we do it, boy?&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent12">But Bruce was slow:</div>
<div class="verse">Angry and sick, but slow. And once when Dora</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
<div class="verse">Found him, deep in the woods between their cabins,</div>
<div class="verse">He almost lost his purpose as she held him,</div>
<div class="verse">Wetting his face with tears.</div>
<div class="indent13">&#8220;Listen!&#8221; she whispered.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I have been down to Doctor, and his new nurse</div>
<div class="verse">Knows&mdash;I can&#8217;t guess how&mdash;knows everything.</div>
<div class="verse">A beautiful, tall woman, and her friend</div>
<div class="verse">The teacher&mdash;she is like her. Colder, though,</div>
<div class="verse">With different, with grey eyes. The new nurse says&mdash;&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;What, Dora, what does she say?&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent17">&#8220;Oh, no, I can&#8217;t&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">I&#8217;ll never, never tell you.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent13">As she ran</div>
<div class="verse">He followed, farther into the still woods;</div>
<div class="verse">Then stopped as she did, startled. For those two&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">It must be those two new ones, those tall women&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Pondered the carcass of a fawn, a spotted</div>
<div class="verse">Three-months fawn that dogs had torn at the throat.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It was the nurse that knelt, lifting brown eyes</div>
<div class="verse">In sorrow, scarcely knowing Dora there.</div>
<div class="verse">The other one bent down to her.</div>
<div class="indent16">&#8220;Stand up.</div>
<div class="verse">They both are here. The boy, too.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent17">Level voiced,</div>
<div class="verse">The teacher touched her friend&#8217;s hair.</div>
<div class="indent18">&#8220;Stand up, stand up.</div>
<div class="verse">The fawn is dead. These others&mdash;&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent17">&#8220;Yes, I know.</div>
<div class="verse">I heard, I saw them. But consider death.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
<div class="verse">Consider this young death awhile, and say&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">But softly&mdash;of what it is the paradigm.</div>
<div class="verse">Do not disdain one death, one single death;</div>
<div class="verse">And when we can, prevent.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent14">The grey eyes cooled,</div>
<div class="verse">Consenting. So the sorrowful one arose.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Come here,&#8221; she said to Dora, and to Bruce</div>
<div class="verse">Behind her. &#8220;We were walking in the woods,</div>
<div class="verse">My visitor and I; we saw this sight.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But Bruce and Dora stared at only her,</div>
<div class="verse">So beautiful, so tall, and at the other</div>
<div class="verse">Strange one by her side.</div>
<div class="indent11">&#8220;We had been talking,</div>
<div class="verse">Children, of you two. No matter if Daniel</div>
<div class="verse">Loves you, little girl of the dark eyes&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t!&#8221; Dora shuddered. &#8220;If he could,</div>
<div class="verse">He&#8217;d have it that I never lived on earth.</div>
<div class="verse">He hates it, having to remember me.</div>
<div class="verse">And that&#8217;s all right. I want it so. But Bruce&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Will be, my dear, the father of your&mdash;listen,</div>
<div class="verse">Listen! You start away.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent12">For both had broken</div>
<div class="verse">Breath, as if with running, and only the hands</div>
<div class="verse">Of the grey-eyed, the firm one, held them there.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I mean,&#8221; and the tall beautiful one blinked,</div>
<div class="verse">Twitching the green selvage of her skirt,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
<div class="verse">&#8220;The foster father. He is young for that;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet he is to be, my child, the chosen one</div>
<div class="verse">Who saves you, and saves it&mdash;the life you carry.</div>
<div class="verse">Your husband. Nothing less. And not in dream.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Bruce turned his head in fear that old Darius</div>
<div class="verse">Listened&mdash;was it he among the hemlocks,</div>
<div class="verse">Stepping so lightly?</div>
<div class="indent10">But the foliage opened</div>
<div class="verse">For a fair, smiling face, and the broad shoulders,</div>
<div class="verse">Burdened with straps, of one who tramped these hills</div>
<div class="verse">By summer, following signs. A brilliance round him,</div>
<div class="verse">Caused by no sun, for none came through the branches,</div>
<div class="verse">Struck silence from all four; until the nurse,</div>
<div class="verse">Nodding as if she knew him, said: &#8220;Due north,</div>
<div class="verse">Pilgrim, is there. Your compass&mdash;have you lost it?</div>
<div class="verse">Well, north is that way&#8221;&mdash;pointing&mdash;&#8220;but stand here</div>
<div class="verse">In patience for some seconds; then we two</div>
<div class="verse">Will guide you back to town for better bearing.</div>
<div class="verse">Can you be patient?&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent10">&#8220;Thank you, yes.&#8221; The giant</div>
<div class="verse">Smiled at her once again.</div>
<div class="indent12">&#8220;You see, my small one,</div>
<div class="verse">Bruce there by your side would break and run,</div>
<div class="verse">Fearing his sweet fate. He even wonders</div>
<div class="verse">Whether some partner, deep in another plan,</div>
<div class="verse">Listens and chides him.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent12">Staring, the boy blushed.</div>
<div class="verse">Then, fearful, he looked up and met her eyes,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
<div class="verse">The nurse&#8217;s distant eyes, that fixed him gently.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;My friend here&mdash;she will tell you more than I can</div>
<div class="verse">Of the black folly born of feud. Attend her.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But the still teacher only parted wide</div>
<div class="verse">Her capable cool lids, and let him see</div>
<div class="verse">Agreement flash between them.</div>
<div class="indent16">&#8220;Someone&#8217;s death&#8221;&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">She forced the words at last&mdash;&#8220;is cheap to buy.</div>
<div class="verse">A minute of man&#8217;s time, and breathing stops.</div>
<div class="verse">The cost is in the echo; for to cease</div>
<div class="verse">Makes sound. So you will hear it coming home,</div>
<div class="verse">The rumor of that death. My friend is right.</div>
<div class="verse">Marry the maiden.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent10">But the words came strangely,</div>
<div class="verse">Out of some older earth, and even she</div>
<div class="verse">The speaker knew their failure; for she frowned.</div>
<div class="verse">Bruce turned his head again, fearing the hemlock</div>
<div class="verse">Heard. Yet no one listened there; no fourth one</div>
<div class="verse">Followed this lofty fellow who in patience</div>
<div class="verse">Folded his arms and smiled&mdash;as if he too</div>
<div class="verse">Had knowledge, and agreed with the grey eyes.</div>
<div class="verse">As Dora did, said Bruce. And yet Darius&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">He paled at the grim image, and remembered,</div>
<div class="verse">Suddenly, that soldier; whose disgust</div>
<div class="verse">If the dear purpose foundered was itself</div>
<div class="verse">A death, along with Dora&#8217;s yesterday.</div>
<div class="verse">Daniel. Who but Daniel was the father</div>
<div class="verse">Of a whole world&#8217;s confusion?</div>
<div class="indent16">And his anger,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
<div class="verse">Running before him, took him from this place,</div>
<div class="verse">This glade where three, left thoughtful, were as figures</div>
<div class="verse">Molded of shadow. Dora was gone with Bruce,</div>
<div class="verse">Gasping and crying &#8220;Wait!&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent14">But the three tall ones</div>
<div class="verse">Listened to nothing human. Hermes came.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Hermes came, and hailing his three peers,</div>
<div class="verse">Spoke Aphrodite&#8217;s name; whose beautiful laughter</div>
<div class="verse">Answered as she glistened in their midst&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">No woman now, but goddess. So Hephaestus</div>
<div class="verse">Hove into their view, and all of the others,</div>
<div class="verse">Manifest together. This was where,</div>
<div class="verse">In tulip and oak shade, they pleased to meet,</div>
<div class="verse">To sit sometimes and say how the world went,</div>
<div class="verse">Mortal and immortal.</div>
<div class="indent10">&#8220;You of the golden</div>
<div class="verse">Shoulders,&#8221; Hermes said, &#8220;bring dreams to one</div>
<div class="verse">Who lived in peace without them.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent17">&#8220;Lived in hate,</div>
<div class="verse">In loathing of those very limbs he fondled&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Poor, poor limbs, so lonely!&#8221; And her insolent</div>
<div class="verse">Laughter shook the listening green leaves.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Yet he would have forgotten, and his only</div>
<div class="verse">Danger been from Ares&#8221;&mdash;who was there,</div>
<div class="verse">Swelling his thick chest, as Hermes spoke&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;From the two minions, old and young, of Ares.</div>
<div class="verse">Such danger can dissolve, for it is wind</div>
<div class="verse">And fury; but the damage that you do,</div>
<div class="verse">Arrogant bright daughter of the dolphins,</div>
<div class="verse">Is endless as waves are, or serpent segments</div>
<div class="verse">The impotent keen knife divides. Have mercy,</div>
<div class="verse">Goddess.&#8221; And he waited. But her lips,</div>
<div class="verse">Unmoving, only teased him; and tormented</div>
<div class="verse">Artemis.</div>
<div class="indent4">&#8220;The man was free of longing,</div>
<div class="verse">And the dark maid of him,&#8221; the huntress said,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Till this one wantoned, wooing him with dreams.</div>
<div class="verse">Then Ares&mdash;common soldier&mdash;fanned the fire</div>
<div class="verse">In those you call his minions.&#8221; Hermes nodded.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;And so our plan&#8217;s perplexed before it ripens.</div>
<div class="verse">Athene, Michael&mdash;tell them how we stood,</div>
<div class="verse">Just here, and heard the boy refuse his function.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But it was known among them even then,</div>
<div class="verse">And so no witness needed. Aphrodite,</div>
<div class="verse">Secure in beauty&#8217;s pride, tilted her head</div>
<div class="verse">To hear, intending mockery of the tale.</div>
<div class="verse">But the wise one withheld it, and majestic</div>
<div class="verse">Michael only folded his broad wings</div>
<div class="verse">As Gabriel did, as Raphael.</div>
<div class="indent13">Yet that last one,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
<div class="verse">Mournful of face and long, had ears for Artemis,</div>
<div class="verse">Nurse to all things aborning, as she mused:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The young one when he comes&mdash;in what men call</div>
<div class="verse">The fall of their brief year&mdash;the roofless infant&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">It was for him we planned. And still we do&mdash;&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">She dared the glittering goddess&mdash;&#8220;still we seek</div>
<div class="verse">Safe birth for the small mother, and for him</div>
<div class="verse">The wailing, the unwanted.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent14">Crooked Hephaestus,</div>
<div class="verse">Clearing his mild throat, remarked in modesty:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;The man works well and silently. He loves,</div>
<div class="verse">In solitude, the comfort of my fire.</div>
<div class="verse">And so in a bowl I brought it. As for her&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">He will not have her near him. I was by;</div>
<div class="verse">I read his thoughts of this.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent13">&#8220;Absurd contriver!</div>
<div class="verse">Artisan of the bellows! Zeus&#8217;s butt!</div>
<div class="verse">As ever, you know nothing.&#8221; Aphrodite</div>
<div class="verse">Sparkled with rage, reviling him. &#8220;You saw</div>
<div class="verse">By daylight, and at labor in the field</div>
<div class="verse">One whom that very night I made my slave.</div>
<div class="verse">Off to your anvil, ass!&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent11">But Hermes calmed</div>
<div class="verse">Their quarrel, lifting his either hand in grace.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Without our father&#8217;s thunder we are fools</div>
<div class="verse">And children. Who decides when lesser gods,</div>
<div class="verse">When angels disagree? Authority absent,</div>
<div class="verse">Silence&mdash;a silver silence&mdash;that is best.&#8221;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
<div class="verse">And like a song they heard it, and they wondered,</div>
<div class="verse">Measuring its notes. Until Apollo,</div>
<div class="verse">Lord of the muses, laughed.</div>
<div class="indent14">&#8220;You heard me humming.</div>
<div class="verse">All to myself I sang it&mdash;with sealed lips.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;What did you sing?&#8221; said Hermes.</div>
<div class="indent17">&#8220;Nothing, nothing.</div>
<div class="verse">My sisters round the world&mdash;a sweet wind brought me,</div>
<div class="verse">Sleepily, this air.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent9">He hummed again,</div>
<div class="verse">And this time closed his eyes. &#8220;Perhaps I see,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">He said, &#8220;some silver moment coming soon&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Necessity for music. But not now.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Nor could those other nine foresee the summer.</div>
<div class="verse">Already, in mid June, high long days</div>
<div class="verse">Hovered the world, and change, like ripening fruit,</div>
<div class="verse">Hung ever, ever plainer. Yet no man,</div>
<div class="verse">No god distinguished more in this green time</div>
<div class="verse">Than purposes that crossed; and ever tighter.</div>
<div class="verse">In Daniel&#8217;s house the woman who was resting&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Daily, in scorn, Berrien spoke the word&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Still did not spare the beautiful dream body</div>
<div class="verse">She sent to him by dark, when Dora too</div>
<div class="verse">Lived by his side and loved him: standing there</div>
<div class="verse">In the shed radiance of one who smiled</div>
<div class="verse">And smiled, and burned his reticence away.</div>
<div class="verse">For he would go to Dora&mdash;come July,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
<div class="verse">Said Daniel, lying afterwards and listening</div>
<div class="verse">As night died between him and the windows,</div>
<div class="verse">He would go there, he would, and say it all;</div>
<div class="verse">He would have Dora, small in his long arms,</div>
<div class="verse">Forever. Yet the sweetness of this thought</div>
<div class="verse">Exhausted him, and hollowed his wild eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">So that he never went.</div>
<div class="indent10">And had he gone,</div>
<div class="verse">What Dora would have seen him come and shivered?</div>
<div class="verse">One whom as strong a dream&mdash;if it was a dream&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Estranged. It was of having, yet not having,</div>
<div class="verse">Bruce for her brave husband. For he mustn&#8217;t&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">He mustn&#8217;t, she said nightly, shutting away</div>
<div class="verse">The vision&mdash;Bruce must never let it be.</div>
<div class="verse">The nurse&mdash;he mustn&#8217;t listen. Yet if he did&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">And then she wept.</div>
<div class="indent9">Darius in the morning,</div>
<div class="verse">Seeing her tears, thought only of his purpose.</div>
<div class="verse">He should conceal it better. She was afraid,</div>
<div class="verse">Was frantic, she might go somewhere and tell.</div>
<div class="verse">That boy&mdash;he was so hard to keep in anger.</div>
<div class="verse">He faltered, and he wilted; he was a fool.</div>
<div class="verse">That boy, the center of confusion&#8217;s cross,</div>
<div class="verse">For still he hated Daniel, still with Darius</div>
<div class="verse">Plotted the loud death; yet loved all day,</div>
<div class="verse">All night the dream of lying in clear peace</div>
<div class="verse">Forever, in dear confidence, with Dora;</div>
<div class="verse">That boy was whom the strangers in this valley</div>
<div class="verse">Watched while the moments went; while June decayed;</div>
<div class="verse">While middle summer dozed; and no leaves fell.</div>

<div class="verse">A hundred people coming to the barn dance,</div>

<div class="verse">Enormous and blood red, and stationary.</div>
<div class="verse">Daniel came, and Berrien, with that woman&mdash;</div>

<div class="verse">Wondering what next&mdash;why she was here.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;The dog!&#8221; he growled, catching on Daniel&#8217;s face,</div>
<div class="verse">In a far corner, hunger and indifference</div>
<div class="verse">Fighting. Hunger&mdash;damn him&mdash;for my child,</div>
<div class="verse">My child, Darius said, whom he has changed;</div>
<div class="verse">And smothering this, the smoke of a pretence</div>
<div class="verse">That nothing here was wrong, nothing at all.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
<div class="verse">The soldier had come back. Darius saw him.</div>
<div class="verse">Red-eyed, drinking water by a droplight,</div>
<div class="verse">And his own conscience hurt him. Daniel lived.</div>
<div class="verse">If Bruce could only raise his eyes a little&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">But they were hangdog, or were fixed in fear</div>
<div class="verse">On those two stranger women. Why in fear?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The music, though.</div>
<div class="indent9">&#8220;Swing your corner lady!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Darius, rocking gently on his heels,</div>
<div class="verse">Was lost again in that, and in the wild</div>
<div class="verse">Mouth organs, going mournful overhead.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;First two gents cross over!&#8221; In his thought</div>
<div class="verse">He crossed; he took that partner by the hand;</div>
<div class="verse">He swung her, swung her, swung her, you know where.</div>
<div class="verse">He promenaded, proudly, and he clapped</div>
<div class="verse">His palms, that sweated bravely. Then the swinging</div>
<div class="verse">Ceased. The set was over. And he sang:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Good boy, Gus! That was calling, old man Glendy!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">They winked at him, wiping their foreheads off;</div>
<div class="verse">Then soon another set. And still he listened</div>
<div class="verse">And watched, and still he saw how Dora sat,</div>
<div class="verse">Trembling, and never danced.</div>
<div class="indent14">But once the soldier,</div>
<div class="verse">Slouching to her side, made mockery signs</div>
<div class="verse">Suggesting that she stand. Darius started</div>
<div class="verse">In anger; then he stopped, for Bruce was up,</div>
<div class="verse">Explaining&mdash;yet avoiding the brute stare;</div>
<div class="verse">And Daniel, in his corner, clenched both fists.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
<div class="verse">Even the strangers knew, for one came over&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">The one with such a neat head on his body,</div>
<div class="verse">And the curled stick&mdash;as if to beat away</div>
<div class="verse">Wild boars escaped here. That was good, was good,</div>
<div class="verse">Darius said; then listened as the music</div>
<div class="verse">Whispered again.</div>
<div class="indent7">Whispered.</div>
<div class="indent14">For the tune</div>
<div class="verse">Had altered. Where was Glendy? Who was this</div>
<div class="verse">Where Glendy had been standing? And what ailed,</div>
<div class="verse">What softened so the clamor of the mouth harps?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;One more couple!&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent9">Who was the intruder,</div>
<div class="verse">Calling in so sweet, so low a voice,</div>
<div class="verse">Strange orders? Yet not strange; for the hot crowd,</div>
<div class="verse">Heedless of any difference, swirled on,</div>
<div class="verse">Loving its evolutions, and no head</div>
<div class="verse">Turned hither.</div>
<div class="indent6">&#8220;Take your Dora by the hand&mdash;&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Darius, looking up, saw how the silver</div>
<div class="verse">Light of the full moon, mature at zenith,</div>
<div class="verse">Fell on the singer. Through one gable window</div>
<div class="verse">It fell, and on no head but his, the silvery</div>
<div class="verse">Singer. He was slender, he was strange;</div>
<div class="verse">And the high moon&mdash;it burned for none but him.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Where&#8217;s Glendy, Gus?&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent11">&#8220;Took sick.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent18">The loud guitar,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
<div class="verse">Hesitating, rallied and persevered;</div>
<div class="verse">But modified its note to a new sweetness,</div>
<div class="verse">A low, a far-off sweetness, as Gus looked,</div>
<div class="verse">Listened, and looked again at the mysterious</div>
<div class="verse">Caller on whose mouth the full moon smiled.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent3">Take your Dora by the hand,</div>
<div class="indent3">Your little Dora, grown so large.</div>
<div class="indent3">By another she was manned,</div>
<div class="indent3">But she is now your loving charge.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent3">Mercy marries you, my boy,</div>
<div class="indent3">And mercy&mdash;oh, it is unjust.</div>
<div class="indent3">But it was born of truth and joy,</div>
<div class="indent3">And lives with misery if it must.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Darius, and then Daniel, comprehending,</div>
<div class="verse">Stared at a hundred dancers who did not.</div>
<div class="verse">Heedless of any change, they stamped and swung,</div>
<div class="verse">Those hundred, as if Glendy still were here&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Old Glendy, whose thin throat still mastered them.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet Daniel saw how Dora, dropping her eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">Sat silent, deathly silent; and how Bruce,</div>
<div class="verse">Guardian to her, looked only down&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Looked everywhere save at the singer, singing:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent3">Take your Dora by the hand.</div>
<div class="indent3">There is life within her waist.</div>
<div class="indent3">And there is woe, unless you stand</div>
<div class="indent3">And love with bravery is graced.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
<div class="indent3">So all the world will know her wed,</div>
<div class="indent3">And all the people call it yours&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent3">The life within her, small and red;</div>
<div class="indent3">And wrathful, were it none but hers.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent3">With you beside her all is well.</div>
<div class="indent3">She will be tended in her time.</div>
<div class="indent3">There is more that I could tell,</div>
<div class="indent3">But Glendy now resumes the rhyme.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Circle four!&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent6">Darius, and then Daniel,</div>
<div class="verse">Dazed, regarded Glendy once again.</div>
<div class="verse">The moonlit one was gone, and only these</div>
<div class="verse">Had seen him&mdash;these and Dora, and dumb Bruce.</div>
<div class="verse">And all of the nine strangers. For they too</div>
<div class="verse">Had listened; bending their bodies, they had weighed,</div>
<div class="verse">Had witnessed every word as it arrived;</div>
<div class="verse">Had watched the boy&#8217;s confusion; then the girl&#8217;s;</div>
<div class="verse">Then both together, as if woe had wed</div>
<div class="verse">Already the poor lovers.</div>
<div class="indent12">&#8220;Nelly Gray!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">The hundred dancers, heedless, went right on;</div>
<div class="verse">And only Berrien&#8217;s boarder, the gold woman</div>
<div class="verse">Who stood so close by Daniel&mdash;only that one</div>
<div class="verse">Kindled. Then she blazed, and Daniel, blushing,</div>
<div class="verse">Knew she had found his thought.</div>
<div class="indent16">So I have lost her&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">This was his thought&mdash;have lost her. Then my love</div>
<div class="verse">Must die, and no man know it. He was true,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
<div class="verse">That singer. It is not my life she carries&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Dora, who was mine for that cold minute;</div>
<div class="verse">Dora, whom I never can forget.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The eyes of the theater woman burned so fiercely,</div>
<div class="verse">Punishing his own, that Daniel shook.</div>
<div class="verse">How could she guess his trouble? Only in dreams</div>
<div class="verse">She knew it, only in dreams, when Dora came.</div>
<div class="verse">Only in darkness. &#8220;Now she disapproves,</div>
<div class="verse">She probes me.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent7">But the woman looked away,</div>
<div class="verse">Suddenly, and signalled to the soldier;</div>
<div class="verse">Who, nodding, went to stand before Darius.</div>
<div class="verse">Daniel saw him there, gesticulating,</div>
<div class="verse">With his feet spread, as if he meant to spring,</div>
<div class="verse">To throttle someone. And Darius blinked.</div>
<div class="verse">But music and the distance drowned their words.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And now the tall nurse, bending over Dora,</div>
<div class="verse">Whispered to her and Bruce; and the boy, rising,</div>
<div class="verse">Reached for a small hand. The singer had said</div>
<div class="verse">To take it, and he took it, and pulled up</div>
<div class="verse">The girl who still was trying to be free,</div>
<div class="verse">To save him.</div>
<div class="indent6">And the music never stopped.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Kiss her if you dare!&#8221; cried old man Glendy.</div>
<div class="verse">And many a dancer did. But neither Bruce</div>
<div class="verse">Nor Dora, arm in arm, had present ears.</div>
<div class="verse">They listened still to what the other singer,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
<div class="verse">Gone now as the moon was from the window,</div>
<div class="verse">Sang and sang again, as if his silvery</div>
<div class="verse">Face never had faded. Arm in arm</div>
<div class="verse">They walked among the dancers to the big door;</div>
<div class="verse">Arm in arm, sleepwalking, they went forth,</div>
<div class="verse">Under the slant moon, and disappeared.</div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Some whispers, like the wake of blowing leaves</div>
<div class="verse">When a swift body passes west, pursued them.</div>
<div class="verse">But Daniel never stirred.</div>
<div class="indent12">Nor old Darius&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Neither did he listen as the sergeant</div>
<div class="verse">Swore, swelling the wrath in his red eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Till most of him was fire. &#8220;Follow him home,</div>
<div class="verse">The fool. He is forgetting it&mdash;the purpose.</div>
<div class="verse">Tear him free. He softens in her arms</div>
<div class="verse">To the sick sound of &#8216;Father.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent15">But Darius,</div>
<div class="verse">Lost in the same sound, was thinking softly:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I had not dreamed of this. She will be friended,</div>
<div class="verse">She will not go alone. He is a good boy,</div>
<div class="verse">Bruce. I never coupled her with him.</div>
<div class="verse">It may be in the cards.&#8221; Whereat the soldier</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
<div class="verse">Left him, spitting disgust.</div>
<div class="indent13">And Daniel saw</div>
<div class="verse">How all of the fair strangers followed soon&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">All of them, as if they were a company.</div>
<div class="verse">They wouldn&#8217;t be, of course. And yet they smiled</div>
<div class="verse">In the same grave degree, as if some secret</div>
<div class="verse">Bound them.</div>
<div class="indent6">And he thought the dapper one,</div>
<div class="verse">Who tapped the sanded floor and twirled his stick,</div>
<div class="verse">His curlicue of a cane&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Communicated thus to the gold woman</div>
<div class="verse">That she too must away. But she was Daniel&#8217;s,</div>
<div class="verse">Berrien&#8217;s; she was not of any company,</div>
<div class="verse">Wandering, like this one. She had come</div>
<div class="verse">Alone to them, in May, and she would go&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Would go, said Daniel, taking her dream body,</div>
<div class="verse">Her beautiful dream body, that was his,</div>
<div class="verse">Was his alone.</div>
<div class="indent6">And suddenly his sadness</div>
<div class="verse">Doubled. For the singer had left living</div>
<div class="verse">None of his sweet hope. Dora was gone,</div>
<div class="verse">A ghost in outer moonlight, a surrendered</div>
<div class="verse">Sweetness, and he stood there like a dead man,</div>
<div class="verse">A noble dead man, numbering his loss.</div>
<div class="verse">Now, multiplied, it smote him. This one too&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">In fall&mdash;he would be losing this one too,</div>
<div class="verse">In fall. Or even here, while he stood looking,</div>
<div class="verse">Here, with that lithe one calling from the door.</div>
<div class="verse">For there he was, the last one to go through,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
<div class="verse">And Daniel thought the signal came again:</div>
<div class="verse">An elbow&#8217;s twitch, a twirl of his live staff,</div>
<div class="verse">His vine that had the strength to stand alone.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But she had arms and eyes for only Daniel,</div>
<div class="verse">Worshiping her now. She seemed as near,</div>
<div class="verse">He whispered to himself, as lamplight must,</div>
<div class="verse">At midnight, to poor moths. And yet no brush</div>
<div class="verse">Of fingers, such as Berrien might have frowned on.</div>
<div class="verse">Simply her brilliance chained him, simply her arms,</div>
<div class="verse">Her eyes, took hold of everything in him</div>
<div class="verse">And hurt it.</div>
<div class="indent6">&#8220;So you let her go,&#8221; she said.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;You shadow of a man, you let her go.</div>
<div class="verse">Those limbs of hers, so beautiful in light,</div>
<div class="verse">In darkness, and the breast you could have bruised,</div>
<div class="verse">Crushing it with yours&mdash;and yet you would not,</div>
<div class="verse">For it is white, is small, and precious to you&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Derelict! Oh, shameful! What a shadow</div>
<div class="verse">Falls on you for lover&mdash;disobedient</div>
<div class="verse">Lover of that girl whom still you crave!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Did her lips part? Was any of it spoken?</div>
<div class="verse">Berrien still watched the weary dancers</div>
<div class="verse">Like one whom nothing moved. Then whence the words?</div>
<div class="verse">And why? For the gold woman&#8217;s only knowledge</div>
<div class="verse">Was a dream knowledge, drawn to him by night</div>
<div class="verse">When her own body slept in her own bed.</div>
<div class="verse">How could she understand? And what untruth</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
<div class="verse">Was working in her, making these sweet sounds?</div>
<div class="verse">Their honey was more false for being heard</div>
<div class="verse">By him, by only him. That other singer&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">He had been true. And troubling. But his song</div>
<div class="verse">Was never to be lost now. Dora was,</div>
<div class="verse">Forever. And he said it must be so.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The woman, though. Her arms. And now her eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">Beating upon him, beautiful, imperious,</div>
<div class="verse">Not to be contradicted. And her lips.</div>
<div class="verse">Lest the unparted lips again deliver</div>
<div class="verse">What was so loud, so terrible&mdash;though heard</div>
<div class="verse">By him, by only him&mdash;he spoke of home.</div>
<div class="verse">Berrien&mdash;wasn&#8217;t she tired? And Berrien was.</div>
<div class="verse">So with no words they went.</div>
<div class="indent14">Some dancers saw them,</div>
<div class="verse">Picking their way, and winked at one another;</div>
<div class="verse">Daniel, with that artificial woman;</div>
<div class="verse">Berrien, with her boarder. What a household!</div>
<div class="verse">None of them looked happy. Three old-fashioned</div>
<div class="verse">People going home. The actress, too&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">An old, old timer, powdered up to kill,</div>
<div class="verse">And painted. You could see it&mdash;Indian summer</div>
<div class="verse">Everywhere. Yet once a pretty world.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">They could not see how beautiful she was.</div>
<div class="verse">Only for Daniel was she beautiful,</div>
<div class="verse">And for those others, strangers here with her,</div>
<div class="verse">Who from the border of MacPherson&#8217;s grove,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
<div class="verse">In their own forms, were watching.</div>
<div class="indent17">Hermes leaned</div>
<div class="verse">Like none but Hermes, graceful as the grass,</div>
<div class="verse">On a slim sapling, serpent-shaped, and said:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;She flaunts us. Aphrodite is not Ares,</div>
<div class="verse">She is not schooled in victory and defeat,</div>
<div class="verse">She is not skilful at surrender&mdash;save</div>
<div class="verse">The lover&#8217;s kind. See? She is bent on that.</div>
<div class="verse">She will not let him go, the farmer there,</div>
<div class="verse">While any of her poison works in him.</div>
<div class="verse">Ares, what if some of your new wisdom&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">You could persuade her, Ares.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent15">But the sullen</div>
<div class="verse">Soldier still was sullen, though a god;</div>
<div class="verse">He would not lift his face as Aphrodite,</div>
<div class="verse">Smiling at them, catlike, kept her way</div>
<div class="verse">With Daniel down the road.</div>
<div class="indent14">&#8220;Apollo&#8217;s song,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Said Hermes, &#8220;&mdash;it was all we needed then.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">He nodded, and the bright musician bowed.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;It was a potent song. The tough old man,</div>
<div class="verse">The tender young, the farmer in his heart&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">All four of them were changed. But now you see&mdash;&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">He pointed, and they looked where Aphrodite,</div>
<div class="verse">Dimming with her companions down the highway,</div>
<div class="verse">Walked as a mortal would; though still they knew</div>
<div class="verse">The goddess by a smile that lingered somewhere,</div>
<div class="verse">Mingling as the moon did with the tops</div>
<div class="verse">Of trees, and scenting midnight with its malice.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
<div class="verse">Artemis, more angry than the rest,</div>
<div class="verse">More like the moon, declining now so clear,</div>
<div class="verse">So cold, beyond the body of this grove,</div>
<div class="verse">Remembered the dead fawn. &#8220;So with that child,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">She brooded. &#8220;If the farmer man confesses,</div>
<div class="verse">Nothing but grief will grow where you and I&mdash;&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">She took Athene&#8217;s hand&mdash;&#8220;have wisely tilled</div>
<div class="verse">And planted. Never then will the boy serve,</div>
<div class="verse">With loving care, my cause&mdash;the cause of the world,</div>
<div class="verse">Of the newborn things whose nurture saves the world.</div>
<div class="verse">The farmer would have let the maiden go&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Sadly, yet Apollo made it sure.</div>
<div class="verse">Or so we said who listened. Yet that one,</div>
<div class="verse">That laughing one, pursues him now and sings,</div>
<div class="verse">And sings&mdash;oh, what low song, what tale of the flesh,</div>
<div class="verse">What burden that may topple his intention?</div>
<div class="verse">Hephaestus, our contriver, you could seal</div>
<div class="verse">His ears, his sleeping eyelids, if you would;</div>
<div class="verse">Even tonight you could.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent12">Hephaestus, pacing</div>
<div class="verse">Oddly the smooth floor, rested his leg,</div>
<div class="verse">The shortened leg Zeus long ago had crippled.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;The farmer&mdash;he works well, and loves the fire</div>
<div class="verse">I gave him. Let him be.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent12">But none of them saw</div>
<div class="verse">His meaning, if he had one. He was lame</div>
<div class="verse">And foolish, and he muttered as he walked,</div>
<div class="verse">And turned and walked again, counting the steps</div>
<div class="verse">Between two oaks that limited his way.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
<div class="verse">The great angels watched him with their wings</div>
<div class="verse">Folded. Standing deeper in the shade,</div>
<div class="verse">They waited with the others while the moon</div>
<div class="verse">Sloped to its rest, the music having wearied</div>
<div class="verse">And stopped, and all the dancers wandered home.</div>

<div class="verse">Dora would have his baby in her house.</div>
<div class="verse">And then she could forget. She wiped her eyes.</div>
<div class="verse">Darius here&mdash;now he would be alone,</div>
<div class="verse">And that perhaps was harder. So &#8220;I do&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Came distantly across the room as she compared</div>
<div class="verse">Their griefs; and when the couple, bent to kiss,</div>

<div class="verse">Turned elsewhere&mdash;on Hephaestus, whom she taunted,</div>
<div class="verse">Teasing him with glances at his broken</div>
<div class="verse">Foot, and at the thickness of his wrists.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Artisan!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Infernal tinker!</div>
<div class="verse">You are not one of us. Then why do you creep</div>
<div class="verse">Each morning, crooked fool, and haunt the man?</div>
<div class="verse">You do, in the poor likeness of a mender&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">What is it that you mend? What is the word?&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Stoves.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent5">&#8220;I&#8217;ll not pronounce it. Such a word!</div>
<div class="verse">I scorn it. And scorn you. And yet I say&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Remember my own strength, that can undo</div>
<div class="verse">The cunningest contriver. No more haunt</div>
<div class="verse">The man. By night, by morning, no more crawl&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">You hear?&mdash;and charm his sadness till it sleeps.</div>
<div class="verse">You think to cure his longing with some lessons,</div>
<div class="verse">Monger, in your art. But my own art</div>
<div class="verse">Is ultimate. Remember, and refrain.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Hephaestus shifted crabwise on his ankles,</div>
<div class="verse">Refusing every glance until the rite</div>
<div class="verse">Was finished, and the people in the room</div>
<div class="verse">Departed. Then he ducked and disappeared,</div>
<div class="verse">Eluding even Hermes, even the sea-grey</div>
<div class="verse">Eyes of sage Athene. He was bound</div>
<div class="verse">For Daniel, whom he haunted every day</div>
<div class="verse">In the same likeness he had first assumed</div>
<div class="verse">When Daniel, missing the comfort of his pipe bowl,</div>
<div class="verse">Got it again, and wondered.</div>
<div class="indent13">Bruce and Dora,</div>
<div class="verse">Heeled by their elders, one of whom still wept,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
<div class="verse">Went home another way; and the inaudible</div>
<div class="verse">Deities went home&mdash;to the green hilltop,</div>
<div class="verse">The high glade where Ares, though he heard,</div>
<div class="verse">Sent down no shout of welcome. Aphrodite,</div>
<div class="verse">Following to where the mountains forked,</div>
<div class="verse">Deserted there; dipping away and flying,</div>
<div class="verse">Like one of her own doves, to Daniel&#8217;s house.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But Daniel stood with someone in the barn</div>
<div class="verse">By the new anvil he had bought, considering</div>
<div class="verse">Hot and cold; and how a hammer&#8217;s blow</div>
<div class="verse">Can bend the iron, not break it.</div>
<div class="indent15">&#8220;When you came,</div>
<div class="verse">That day, and brought my pipe&mdash;I still am puzzled&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">How did you do it, man?&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent12">&#8220;Look here! I take</div>
<div class="verse">This strip of ten-gauge, and I heat it thus&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Pretend the forge is going&mdash;then I twist it,</div>
<div class="verse">So, until I have a perfect handle</div>
<div class="verse">For the fire tongs you need.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent14">No other answer.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;See? Now when you have the bellows going&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Watch me&mdash;this is what the draft can do.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">No other answer. So the pupil bent,</div>
<div class="verse">Considering.</div>
<div class="indent6">And neither of them saw&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Or Daniel did not&mdash;bright eyes at the door,</div>
<div class="verse">Brimming with alien purpose.</div>
<div class="indent14">&#8220;Your good wife,&#8221;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
<div class="verse">The woman said&mdash;and Daniel, starting round,</div>
<div class="verse">Saw how the gold one narrowed her long lids</div>
<div class="verse">Toward him who held the hammer&mdash;&#8220;sends for you.</div>
<div class="verse">She tells you this is wasting time, is wearing</div>
<div class="verse">The day out; is pure nothing. And she says&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Dismiss the tinker. Let him go his way.</div>
<div class="verse">He is not wanted here.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent11">The hammer dropped.</div>
<div class="verse">But Daniel shook his head at her.</div>
<div class="indent16">&#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t</div>
<div class="verse">Know. It isn&#8217;t woman&#8217;s work. Besides,</div>
<div class="verse">It keeps me safe from thinking certain thoughts.</div>
<div class="verse">She wouldn&#8217;t know that either. Or would you.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He flushed, remembering how much she knew</div>
<div class="verse">If dreams had body, and if at the dance</div>
<div class="verse">It was her own live lips that so rebuked him.</div>
<div class="verse">But no, that couldn&#8217;t be. He said it again,</div>
<div class="verse">And turned to the lame tinker.</div>
<div class="indent15">&#8220;We&#8217;ll not stop,</div>
<div class="verse">For her or anybody. Tell me now&mdash;&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Whereat Hephaestus grinned, and Aphrodite,</div>
<div class="verse">Stamping her white foot, that all but showed</div>
<div class="verse">Immortal through the slipper, let them be.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Yet not for long. The lame one in his room,</div>
<div class="verse">That night and every night, was pinched awake</div>
<div class="verse">By fingers he well knew; and knew as well</div>
<div class="verse">How in the darkness, sweating, to endure.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
<div class="verse">For he was steadfast&mdash;like his tossing pupil,</div>
<div class="verse">Daniel, in the bed where Berrien lay.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Hour after hour, that night and every night,</div>
<div class="verse">Berrien strove to riddle his strange words,</div>
<div class="verse">His mumbled words, that stubbornly kept on</div>
<div class="verse">Refusing what was whispered. What was that?</div>
<div class="verse">Or was it anything? Was someone by them,</div>
<div class="verse">Whispering to him? She lay and wondered,</div>
<div class="verse">Doubtful of his mind, that so could mumble,</div>
<div class="verse">Endlessly, at nothing, maybe nothing.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But it was never nothing. Aphrodite,</div>
<div class="verse">Going between Hephaestus&#8217; bed and his,</div>
<div class="verse">Was a changed goddess, bearing every charm</div>
<div class="verse">Of beauty she possessed, that he once more</div>
<div class="verse">Might madden. Dora came there too, he thought,</div>
<div class="verse">And wept in her first figure, the demure one,</div>
<div class="verse">The thin and still one, that was his again&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;It is, it is!&#8221; the whisper at his side</div>
<div class="verse">Said tirelessly, &#8220;whenever you will reach</div>
<div class="verse">And take it. Be the lover you were then,</div>
<div class="verse">And take it, take it, take it. Go and be</div>
<div class="verse">Her lover; speak the truth as winter once,</div>
<div class="verse">As warmness, spoke it for you. Is it late?</div>
<div class="verse">Is there a foolish thing that now deforms her?</div>
<div class="verse">And for that thing a father? Is it published</div>
<div class="verse">That he is the thing&#8217;s foolish, foolish father?</div>
<div class="verse">Have none of it. Forget these moments since,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
<div class="verse">And take her. She is yours&mdash;see how she weeps</div>
<div class="verse">And wishes she had Daniel&#8217;s hands forever&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Forever it could be, if you were bold</div>
<div class="verse">And shouted without shame the burning truth&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Forever, Daniel, ever down her small</div>
<div class="verse">Smooth sides; or where her breasts, that breathed for you,</div>
<div class="verse">Might breathe again.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent10">He moaned and turned away,</div>
<div class="verse">Tormented. And sometimes the whisper died,</div>
<div class="verse">So that he looked again. It was an artful</div>
<div class="verse">Death, increasing torment, for the two</div>
<div class="verse">Shone there as always. They were never gone,</div>
<div class="verse">Those two, while August lasted; and while summer</div>
<div class="verse">Saddened on the stalk.</div>
<div class="indent10">For rust had bent</div>
<div class="verse">The hayheads while he dreamed, and far to north</div>
<div class="verse">The feet of fall were coming. Daniel rose</div>
<div class="verse">Each day a wearier man, yet not apostate</div>
<div class="verse">Ever to his black anvil, where with the smith</div>
<div class="verse">He lost himself in lessons hot and cold.</div>
<div class="verse">And still the woman came to call him in.</div>
<div class="verse">And still he could refuse her.</div>
<div class="indent14">So September,</div>
<div class="verse">With speckles on its back, slid like a serpent</div>
<div class="verse">Over the cool slopes; and lucky houses,</div>
<div class="verse">Filled with a winter&#8217;s wood, sat where they were,</div>
<div class="verse">Complacent; while upon the homeless highways</div>
<div class="verse">Wanderers appeared.</div>
<div class="indent10">So Dora&#8217;s time</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
<div class="verse">Came slowly, slowly on, with few to know</div>
<div class="verse">Or care when it should come; except Darius,</div>
<div class="verse">Who prowled each afternoon to Bruce&#8217;s house,</div>
<div class="verse">Consoling himself there for being lonely;</div>
<div class="verse">Except the little roundhead and his anxious</div>
<div class="verse">Wife; except those strangers up the mountain;</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It came, the time of Dora, when no man,</div>
<div class="verse">No man of all her three, was home for messenger.</div>
<div class="verse">Darius snored in his own house&mdash;a ball</div>
<div class="verse">Of skin beneath the bedclothes&mdash;and the night</div>
<div class="verse">Was early yet for Bruce, who with his father</div>
<div class="verse">Tramped the low road from Brownlee&#8217;s where they worked,</div>
<div class="verse">And working, thought of Dora&mdash;all day long</div>
<div class="verse">Of Dora&#8217;s time, next week or the week after.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But it was now, and none of all the three men</div>
<div class="verse">Home to be her messenger! The doctor&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">How could he be told the time had come</div>
<div class="verse">For pain, for crying out? Then Bruce&#8217;s mother,</div>
<div class="verse">Moaning, was so helpless at the door,</div>
<div class="verse">Calling, calling, calling: &#8220;Bruce, where are you?</div>
<div class="verse">Go and get the doctor! Hurry, boy!&#8221;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
<div class="verse">But Bruce was on the low road, and the only</div>
<div class="verse">Ears that heard were scattered up the sky.</div>
<div class="verse">Artemis, on top of Silver Mountain,</div>
<div class="verse">Heard; and woke Athene; and the others,</div>
<div class="verse">Knowing it was time, went with them both</div>
<div class="verse">Like falling stars&mdash;all of them, like stars,</div>
<div class="verse">To drop and stand in darkness by the door</div>
<div class="verse">While Bruce&#8217;s mother, moaning, called and called:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Where are you, boy? Hurry! Get the doctor!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And still another heard. But Aphrodite,</div>
<div class="verse">Listening while Daniel sat, could smile</div>
<div class="verse">And wait; could think and wait. It was the time</div>
<div class="verse">For punishing this man who in his dreams</div>
<div class="verse">Refused her. She could wait and let it work&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">The punishment she planned.</div>
<div class="indent14">For she had looked</div>
<div class="verse">Last night along the valley, and seen coming,</div>
<div class="verse">Hapless on the highway, two small wanderers,</div>
<div class="verse">And said: They shall be mine.</div>
<div class="indent15">She heard the moaning</div>
<div class="verse">Cease, and knew that Artemis was there.</div>
<div class="verse">The nurse was there, and Dora would be crying</div>
<div class="verse">Softly: &#8220;Save me, save me! Send for him!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">So Aphrodite, gathering her sly strength,</div>
<div class="verse">Waited no longer.</div>
<div class="indent7">Where were those poor wanderers&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">That pair? But she had seen them, and she knew.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
<div class="verse">She saw them even now at the abandoned</div>
<div class="verse">Chapel down the old road, trying doors</div>
<div class="verse">And windows, and forlornly turning in</div>
<div class="verse">Where nothing was but darkness; and in darkness,</div>
<div class="verse">Nothing but cobwebs.</div>
<div class="indent10">Smiling a last smile,</div>
<div class="verse">Vindictive, at the sitter, she uprose</div>
<div class="verse">And scented the whole night, the outer night</div>
<div class="verse">Of fields and barns and houses, as she flew</div>
<div class="verse">And flew, tinting earth with a false dawn</div>
<div class="verse">As in her brilliant singleness she flew</div>
<div class="verse">And flew to be the first where Hermes came.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For even now the tall nurse&mdash;goddess again</div>
<div class="verse">In the dooryard where they clustered&mdash;told her peers:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;The time! It is the time! Go, two of you&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Hermes, shall it be? With Gabriel?&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">And bring him here, the man of herbs she cries for.</div>
<div class="verse">I could do all alone, for I am skilful,</div>
<div class="verse">I am the green deliveress. Yet go&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Gabriel, with Hermes&mdash;while I soothe</div>
<div class="verse">And ready her. The horses that he drives&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">You hear them now, drawing the tired one home.</div>
<div class="verse">But have no pity. Hurry and intercept him.</div>
<div class="verse">Say it is the nurse&mdash;say anything&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">But bring him here, the mortal man of herbs,</div>
<div class="verse">Between you lest she die.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent13">The feet of Hermes</div>
<div class="verse">Glistened as the staff in his right hand</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
<div class="verse">Touched Gabriel on the nearer wing; then lightly</div>
<div class="verse">Touched him again. And so the pair departed.</div>
<div class="verse">Before the goddess turned they were a rustle</div>
<div class="verse">In the far woods; and Artemis went in</div>
<div class="verse">Where Dora lay.</div>
<div class="indent7">&#8220;The doctor&mdash;he is sent for.</div>
<div class="verse">Child! What are you staring at?&#8221; For Dora</div>
<div class="verse">Shuddered, and alternately her eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Opened and closed in terror, as at brightness</div>
<div class="verse">Impossible, brought near. But then she smiled.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;It was my own mistake&mdash;the way I am.</div>
<div class="verse">You were so different. You shone in the door</div>
<div class="verse">Like candles, you were like a statue lady&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Different from us. I didn&#8217;t know you.</div>
<div class="verse">Now I do, though.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent9">She permitted hands</div>
<div class="verse">To smooth, to cool her as she lay in fever,</div>
<div class="verse">And as the pain returned; while Artemis</div>
<div class="verse">Looked gravely, out of eyes she kept in shadow,</div>
<div class="verse">At the small face whereon the truth had fallen;</div>
<div class="verse">Looked, and wondered fearfully. Had Hermes,</div>
<div class="verse">Had Gabriel heard the horses? Found the man?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But Aphrodite was there first&mdash;an ancient</div>
<div class="verse">Gypsy, rising out of the dim road</div>
<div class="verse">And shrilling between wheels:</div>
<div class="indent15">&#8220;Doctor, Doctor!</div>
<div class="verse">Come to the dead church&mdash;the one they don&#8217;t</div>
<div class="verse">Sing songs in any more. A poverty fellow</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
<div class="verse">And his sick queen&mdash;not my people, but I pity,</div>
<div class="verse">Pity them&mdash;they lie in the carriage shed.</div>
<div class="verse">Or she does, the queen. In all the world</div>
<div class="verse">No friend, and both afraid. They have walked miles</div>
<div class="verse">From nowhere, and no house would take them in.</div>
<div class="verse">She whimpers with the young thing in her belly,</div>
<div class="verse">The babe she has to bear. Come with me, Doctor,</div>
<div class="verse">And help her. Be the one man in the world</div>
<div class="verse">To help her.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent6">&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; His glasses peered</div>
<div class="verse">Through the poor light the buggy lamp cast down.</div>

<div class="verse">&#8220;The old one.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent6">&#8220;Even mice won&#8217;t go near that.</div>
<div class="verse">Mischief&mdash;you mean mischief. Out of the way,</div>
<div class="verse">Granny!&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent5">But she seized the reins and said:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Good doctor! Be the one man in the world&mdash;&#8221;</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And why it was he knew not, but he went</div>
<div class="verse">Where she did, down the sod road toward that moldy</div>
<div class="verse">Building where no hymnsong had been heard</div>
<div class="verse">Since war days, and where beggars&mdash;did she lie?&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Might be or not be.</div>
<div class="indent9">So when Hermes came,</div>
<div class="verse">And Gabriel, there was silence on the highway&mdash;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
<div class="verse">Soft as they listened, never the good sound</div>
<div class="verse">Of hooves, of whirring felloes.</div>
<div class="indent15">Long they looked</div>
<div class="verse">And listened; then were back in Bruce&#8217;s dooryard,</div>
<div class="verse">Signalling their presence; so that Artemis,</div>
<div class="verse">Stooping at the window, saw them desolate,</div>
<div class="verse">And knew herself defeated.</div>
<div class="indent13">&#8220;Aphrodite!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">She only thought the word, but Dora stared</div>
<div class="verse">And begged of her: &#8220;Has someone&mdash;has he come?</div>
<div class="verse">The doctor? Bruce? Where&#8217;s Bruce?&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent18">&#8220;Be patient, dear.</div>
<div class="verse">In time, in time. The doctor was not found.</div>
<div class="verse">But there is time, and I myself have medicines&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">You trust me?&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent6">Dora nodded.</div>
<div class="indent14">&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go, child,</div>
<div class="verse">For certain things&mdash;for such help as I need.</div>
<div class="verse">Be patient a few minutes. She is here.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">For Bruce&#8217;s mother, torturing her hands</div>
<div class="verse">As if they were another&#8217;s on the rack,</div>
<div class="verse">Stood by them, bent and weeping.</div>
<div class="indent17">All were there</div>
<div class="verse">When Artemis, the doorlight shut behind her,</div>
<div class="verse">Shouted. Even Aphrodite smiled</div>
<div class="verse">And innocently listened, fair as ever</div>
<div class="verse">In the fine light that clothed her&mdash;no more gypsy,</div>
<div class="verse">And no more theater woman. Even Ares&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">All of them were there, with lame Hephaestus</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
<div class="verse">Filling his low place among the pear trees,</div>

<div class="verse">Enemy of all&#8221;&mdash;to Aphrodite&mdash;</div>

<div class="indent10">&#8220;I have mended,</div>

<div class="verse">His little mother&#8217;s whimpers, and the cry&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Sudden, as if death were in the room&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Of Dora when she saw him. And his father&#8217;s</div>
<div class="verse">Feebleness&mdash;now he remembered that,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
<div class="verse">And groaned.</div>
<div class="indent6">&#8220;But couldn&#8217;t the nurse&mdash;for she was there&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Wouldn&#8217;t the nurse have known?&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent16">&#8220;I tell you, boy,</div>
<div class="verse">I have no nurse. Something is stranger here&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Giddup!&mdash;than God is ever going to tell me.</div>
<div class="verse">Nurse? There was no such.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent14">And the horses galloped,</div>
<div class="verse">Jingling their bright bridles, till the dooryard</div>
<div class="verse">Darkened them, and Bruce&#8217;s mother stumbled,</div>
<div class="verse">Her apron at her face, among the plum trees.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;I am alone,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;except for him&mdash;&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">She pointed where her husband, on a stone</div>
<div class="verse">As grey as he was, sat and held his forehead&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;We are alone now, my boy. Too late,</div>
<div class="verse">Doctor. Even the nurse is gone. The child,</div>
<div class="verse">The dear child, is dead. They both are dead&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Dora, and the other one that never,</div>
<div class="verse">Never, never breathed.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent12">She clutched at Bruce,</div>
<div class="verse">Feeling the doctor brush them as he passed,</div>
<div class="verse">Then feeling not at all. She only nodded,</div>
<div class="verse">Nodded, as her son repeated: &#8220;Dead&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Dora, she is dead.&#8221; And bore her in,</div>
<div class="verse">A limp superfluous bundle.</div>
<div class="indent13">&#8220;Oh, my boy!&#8221;&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Perceptibly her white lips lived again&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Beautiful! One thing about her going,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
<div class="verse">Oh, my boy, was beautiful. She saw&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Or thought she saw&mdash;ten angels in the room.</div>
<div class="verse">She counted them. But only three had wings.</div>
<div class="verse">She counted the big wings. And said the nurse</div>
<div class="verse">Was queen above all others.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent14">&#8220;Nurse? What nurse?&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">The doctor in the doorway shook his head,</div>
<div class="verse">Frowning, as if to free it from the cobweb</div>
<div class="verse">Sound of that false word. &#8220;There was no such&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But the small mother never would believe&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">He knew it&mdash;and Bruce never would believe.</div>
<div class="verse">Who had this tall impostor woman been?</div>
<div class="verse">And why? And who the other one? Bruce had said:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;A teacher, too&mdash;her friend.&#8221; There was no such&mdash;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The doctor shook his head. Shame on those bunglers&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Butcherers of girls&mdash;who with their knotted</div>
<div class="verse">Grass roots and their needles&mdash;natural thorns&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Had poisoned the sweet blood, the delicate place.</div>
<div class="verse">Where were they, vagrants, now? Could any law</div>
<div class="verse">Catch up with their coarse hands, and cleanse the world</div>
<div class="verse">Of meddlers on the march? For they were somewhere</div>
<div class="verse">Still, the doctor knew; and looked at Bruce</div>
<div class="verse">Bent dumbly over Dora. In good time</div>
<div class="verse">The boy would feel. He was so quiet now&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">An animal, playing dead.</div>
<div class="indent12">Then Daniel stood there&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Daniel, with Darius at his heels:</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
<div class="verse">An old hound whom giant grief had gentled.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet he could move, and did, to where no daughter</div>
<div class="verse">Welcomed his hard hand; which nevertheless</div>
<div class="verse">Hovered and touched her&mdash;touched her, so that tears</div>
<div class="verse">Followed, and streamed his face.</div>
<div class="indent16">&#8220;I brought him here,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Said Daniel. &#8220;I was told of it by one&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">By two&mdash;but they are gone. They do not matter.</div>
<div class="verse">Both of them are gone. They said they knew&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">My lodgers&mdash;then they went. But that&#8217;s no matter.</div>
<div class="verse">I told her father, and he came with me.</div>
<div class="verse">Look at him now. And her. We are not enemies.</div>
<div class="verse">Who is my enemy?&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent10">&#8220;I was,&#8221; said Bruce.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;You were. And I was Dora&#8217;s. What I did&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;You did. But never tell it. As my friend</div>
<div class="verse">In sorrow, never say it. There are ears&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He went to where his mother, staring up,</div>
<div class="verse">Saw none but that dear face.</div>
<div class="indent14">Then Daniel&#8217;s stillness</div>
<div class="verse">Reigned in the room.</div>
<div class="indent10">Even the doctor, going,</div>
<div class="verse">Went as a thought does, thinly; but his mind</div>
<div class="verse">Was more with Mary and her living child,</div>
<div class="verse">In the lost church, than here.</div>
<div class="indent15">A living child.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
<div class="verse">He must go back to that small son; must listen</div>
<div class="verse">To the soft mother&#8217;s voice. Why had he stopped her?</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Quiet. No more talking.&#8221; Was even then</div>
<div class="verse">This mystery in his head, this hazy mirror</div>
<div class="verse">Of a much older birth? Who was it? When?</div>
<div class="verse">What torment not to remember. Just like this,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet where? He drove and thought; and was the image</div>
<div class="verse">Of a whole people, impotent to see now</div>
<div class="verse">The one god it had.</div>
<div class="indent9">So three old friends,</div>
<div class="verse">By death remade, stood looking down at Dora.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Already, in this moment before silver</div>
<div class="verse">Morning, ten were on their way to sea.</div>
<div class="verse">Already, over mountains and rock rivers&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Tawny with high autumn, yet no sun</div>
<div class="verse">Uprisen had revealed it&mdash;Hermes sped</div>
<div class="verse">And spoke not. At the center of his band,</div>
<div class="verse">Encircled, he was thoughtful as he flew</div>
<div class="verse">And flew to where a smoking funnel waited,</div>
<div class="verse">By a smooth prow whereon the ten would ride,</div>
<div class="verse">Would ride the waste Atlantic.</div>
<div class="indent15">&#8220;They were small,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
<div class="verse">These people, they were pitiful and small,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Said Hermes, half aloud. &#8220;Yet not unworthy,</div>
<div class="verse">Nobles, of our regard.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent11">&#8220;They did not guess,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Said Artemis, &#8220;how small.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent13">&#8220;They could not measure,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Flashed the grey eyes of swift Athene, flying,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Difference. They were lonely. They had nothing</div>
<div class="verse">Past them to compare. They do not move,</div>
<div class="verse">These persons, among greater persons still.</div>
<div class="verse">The knowledge of the difference is all.</div>
<div class="verse">Mortals with art to measure it are never</div>
<div class="verse">Pitiful.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent5">&#8220;I thought,&#8221; mused Aphrodite,</div>
<div class="verse">Beautiful by night as her own star,</div>
<div class="verse">Her morning&#8217;s mirror, up now in the east,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I thought I met a presence in that musty</div>
<div class="verse">Stable. Felt a power. Yet all so quiet&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Not even the black beetles crept away.</div>
<div class="verse">Queer, if it was a god&mdash;their only god,</div>
<div class="verse">And none of the fools knew.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent14">&#8220;It was your own</div>
<div class="verse">Mind&#8217;s darkness,&#8221; Ares muttered; and Hephaestus</div>
<div class="verse">Laughed&mdash;at Aphrodite he could laugh,</div>
<div class="verse">Now that his limbs were free.</div>
<div class="indent15">&#8220;Was there a song?</div>
<div class="verse">Even a musty music? Where a god is,</div>
<div class="verse">Surely the air will sound.&#8221; Apollo hummed,</div>
<div class="verse">Remembering the barn dance and the moon.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Did you hear anything to prove a presence?&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Artemis, her green robe gilded suddenly</div>
<div class="verse">By the first beams of sun, was angry still.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;She heard but her own hatefulness, that plotted</div>
<div class="verse">Death.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent4">&#8220;I left the living in your hands&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Yours, and the mighty angel&#8217;s. If you erred,</div>
<div class="verse">Darling of fawns and virgins, I regret,</div>
<div class="verse">As you must, any faltering of skill.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Regret!&#8221; The speed of Artemis redoubled</div>
<div class="verse">As fury filled her. &#8220;Lying, laughing word!</div>
<div class="verse">You poison the whole dawn with it, as then</div>
<div class="verse">You poisoned&mdash;for I know you did&mdash;the thorns,</div>
<div class="verse">The rare leaves I used.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent12">But Hermes cried:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Peace, peace between you, daughters! What is done</div>
<div class="verse">Is done. There the ship rides that we take&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">As one we take it, homing to those lands</div>
<div class="verse">Where sleep is our best portion. Only sleep.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He sighed, and the archangels echoed him:</div>
<div class="verse">Those three whose sire, unknown to them last night,</div>
<div class="verse">Had dreamed again&mdash;a star above a stable.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Not even sleep,&#8221; said Michael. &#8220;No, not even</div>
<div class="verse">Sleep,&#8221; droned weary Gabriel. But Raphael&#8217;s</div>
<div class="verse">Sadness was for Artemis to see,</div>
<div class="verse">And seeing, to have pity on, that no word</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
<div class="verse">Henceforth could express.</div>
<div class="indent13">For now the ship</div>
<div class="verse">Whistled, and the spires above the harbor</div>
<div class="verse">Glistened, and the hawsers, letting go,</div>
<div class="verse">Dangled in salt.</div>
<div class="indent7">So easterly they sailed,</div>
<div class="verse">And sailed; then south a little. And the crew</div>
<div class="verse">Thought only of the Pillars, of the inland</div>
<div class="verse">Sea where waves were smaller. But these ten,</div>
<div class="verse">Prone on the prow, disdained the autumn danger</div>
<div class="verse">Of storm, of the dark swell. Their daily vision&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Common to them all, since reconciled&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Was the long night ahead; or over Asia,</div>
<div class="verse">Centuries upon centuries of flying,</div>
<div class="verse">Flying where no desert, green with the Word,</div>
<div class="verse">Blossomed and blessed them.</div>
<div class="indent14">Now as in a dream</div>
<div class="verse">Never to be redreamed the hills behind them,</div>
<div class="verse">Huddling that valley, muffled its fine cries</div>
<div class="verse">Of people trapped in sorrow. Even its glad souls,</div>
<div class="verse">Silenced, were obscure as drops of dew</div>
<div class="verse">Hung in the wild Antipodes. No mortal</div>
<div class="verse">Summer would be given these again:</div>
<div class="verse">These deities, these angels, who as the dark sea</div>
<div class="verse">Heaved went on themselves as waves do,</div>
<div class="verse">Wearily, yet smiling as in a dream.</div>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
